# [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/) and [Qualcomm AI-Hub](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/)

In collaboration with Qualcomm, this initiative introduces an innovative solution for end-to-end model customization and deployment at the edge, leveraging the power of Amazon SageMaker and Qualcomm AI Hub. This seamless cloud-to-edge AI development experience allows developers to create optimized, high-performance machine learning solutions using the "Bring Your Own Model" (BYOM) and "Bring Your Own Data" (BYOD) frameworks. These solutions cater to various industry needs, from real-time analytics and predictive maintenance to personalized customer experiences and autonomous systems.


# Examples

## Yolo

We are adding a set of examples which demonstrate how to fine-tune YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model, using a custom dataset on Amazon SageMaker. The fine-tuning process utilizes a single ml.g5.2xlarge instance, equipped with an NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPU. After fine-tuning, we showcase how to optimize the model with Qualcomm AI Hub, enabling seamless deployment across edge devices powered by Snapdragon and Qualcomm platforms.
